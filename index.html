        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        I am a highly motivated cybersecurity student with a passion for
        information technology and its security. Currently pursuing a Master of
        Science in Cybersecurity at the University of Houston, I hold a solid
        foundation in this field. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and
        skills to contribute effectively to organizational security. My
        technical expertise includes programming in Python, Java, and
        JavaScript, with a keen understanding of cybersecurity essentials like
        OWASP, Nmap, Wireshark, and IDS/IPS. I have hands-on experience in
        vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and reporting. I'm
        pursuing CompTIA Security+ and have already achieved IBM Security
        Essentials certification. Alongside my technical abilities, I possess
        strong interpersonal and communication skills, making me a valuable team
        player. My goal is to leverage my academic and practical experiences to
        enhance security measures for organizations.
